# ADO.NET

ADO.NET is a set of computer software components that programmers can use to access data and data services from a database. It is a part of the base class library that is included with the Microsoft .NET Framework.

 It is commonly used by programmers to access and modify data stored in relational database systems, though it can also access data in non-relational data sources.

ADO.NET is sometimes considered an evolution of ActiveX Data Objects (ADO) technology, but was changed so extensively that it can be considered an entirely new product.
